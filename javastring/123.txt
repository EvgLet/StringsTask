Probably the most important step forward in objectoriented design is the
design patterns movement chronicled in Design Patterns by Gamma
Helm Johnson Vlissides AddisonWesley 1995 That book shows 23
different solutions to particular classes of problems In this book the
basic concepts of design patterns will be introduced along with examples
This should whet your appetite to read Design Patterns by Gamma
a source of what has now become an essential almost mandatory
vocabulary for OOP programmers
The latter part of this book contains an example of the design evolution
process starting with an initial solution and moving through the logic
and process of evolving the solution to more appropriate designs The
program shown a trash sorting simulation has evolved over time and
you can look at that evolution as a prototype for the way your own
design can start as an adequate solution to a particular problem and
evolve into a flexible approach to a class of problems
